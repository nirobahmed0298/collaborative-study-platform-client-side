**10 bullet points key features** : 
- Role-Based Access Control: The website features role-based access, allowing admins, tutors, and students to have different permissions and views.
* Dynamic Error Handling:  An error page (404, 500, etc.) is dynamically displayed based on the error type, providing a visually distinct background for each error (e.g., red for 404, orange for 500).
- User Authentication: Users are required to authenticate before accessing certain sections. The user role (admin, tutor, student) is determined upon login and is used for routing and permission handling.
* Admin Dashboard: Admin users have access to a dashboard where they can view, search, and manage all users, including the ability to promote users to different roles or remove inappropriate content.
- Search Functionality: Admins can search for users by name or email using the search functionality built on the backend, ensuring faster and more efficient management.
* Manage Study Sessions: Admin users can view all study sessions created by tutors, approve or reject sessions, and modify their details such as whether they are paid or free.
- Session Approval Workflow: When a session is approved, a modal popup appears to let admins specify whether the session is paid or free and input the amount if it is paid.
* User Profile Management: Tutors can create study sessions with detailed information such as title, description, dates, and registration fee. Admins can modify or reject any sessions as needed.
- Responsive Design: The website is fully responsive, offering an optimal experience across devices, from desktops to tablets and smartphones.
* Material Management: Admin users can view and manage uploaded materials, removing any outdated or inappropriate content to maintain the quality and relevance of the platform's resources.
